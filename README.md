Frequency Domain Image Smoothing :By utilizing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), we can manipulate the spectral components of an image to reduce noise and blur sharp transitions. Overview The core of this project is the imagesoothingFD.ipynb notebook, which demonstrates the transition from the spatial domain to the frequency domain to perform image processing tasks that are often more efficient than standard spatial convolutions. Features Fourier Transform: Conversion of grayscale images into their frequency spectrum. Ideal Lowpass Filter (ILPF): Demonstrates sharp frequency truncation and the resulting "ringing" artifacts (Gibbs phenomenon). Butterworth Lowpass Filter (BLPF): A smoother alternative that provides a better balance between blurring and artifact reduction. Visualization: Side-by-side comparisons of original images, their power spectra, and the filtered results. Requirements To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries: numpy ,matplotlib ,opencv-python (cv2) You can install the dependencies using pip: Bash pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python How to Use Clone the Repository: Bash git clone https://github.com/Arebu18/ArebMY/edit/main/README.md Run the Notebook: Open imagesoothingFD.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab. Load your Image: Ensure you have an image file available or update the path in the notebook to point to your target image. Observe the Results: The notebook will output the frequency spectrum and the effects of different cutoff frequencies (D) on the final output
